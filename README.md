# wordle-clone
A Wordle clone is a word-guessing game where players have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback by highlighting letters: green for correct letters in the right position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and gray for incorrect letters. Simple and addictive!
